# easywifi
the easiest way to add wifi networks on linux

![easywificover][cover]

# Purpose

I created this because after trying many different tools to connect to wifi networks on linux I found that `nmcli` was the best. The only problem with it is the commands aren't very easy to remember, and instead of searching through the help everytime I wanted a tool to allow me to connect easily. Easywifi is this tool. It speeds up the time it takes to add new wifi connections and to switch between them.

# Features

* Scan for wifi networks
* List network devices
* List saved network profiles
* Connect to saved networks
* Setup new networks

# Requirements

No libraries are needed just the [nmcli](http://manpages.ubuntu.com/manpages/bionic/en/man1/nmcli.1.html) tool
